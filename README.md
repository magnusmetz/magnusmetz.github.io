# Magnus Metz Blog

This site is based on <http://vis.supstat.com>. The original articles were mostly overtaken and partly modified to serve as a personal reference. In addition further posts extend the blog.

When we see fancy graphs in a paper or a webpage, we often wonder how they
were made. This website serves as a gallery of statistical graphics and
visualizations with reproducible program code that makes the plots. In addition further applications in R are documented.
